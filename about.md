# About us

Cambridge Universities First Aid Society is a student society open to members from Cambridge University , Anglia Ruskin University and Cambridge Regional College. During term time we organise regular weekly meetings, which include presentations, first aid scenarios and talks from healthcare professionals. We also run  social events for our members, such as formals, BBQs and bowling trips.

CUFAS is affiliated with St John Ambulance Cambridge Universities Unit. As part of this organisation we are able to provide training, support and equipment for our members. We provide first aid cover locally,  at events ranging from night clubs and May Balls to the Duxford air shows. Our members also go further afield at larger events such as V Festival and the London Marathon.

St John Ambulance Cambridge Universities Unit was established in 1989 and is one of the oldest St John Ambulance university units in the country. We are one of the busiest St John Ambulance units in Cambridgeshire, and have access to some of the most experienced members. This allows our new members the opportunity to provide first aid cover at a wide range of different event types, while remaining under the supervision of, and learning from our more experienced members.
