Cambridge Universities First Aid Society is a student society open to members from Cambridge University and Anglia Ruskin University. During term time we organise regular weekly meetings, which include presentations, first aid scenarios and talks from healthcare professionals. We also run social events for our members, such as bowling trips, meals out and BBQs.

CUFAS is affiliated with St John Ambulance Cambridge Universities Unit. As part of this organisation we are able to provide more formal training and support for our members. As part of St John, we help provide help first aid cover locally, at events ranging from sports matches to May Balls. Our members also go further afield at larger events such as V Festival and the London Marathon.

St John Ambulance Cambridge Universities Unit was established in 1989 and is one of the oldest St John Ambulance university units in the country.
