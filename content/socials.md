As well as our first aid based events, CUFAS also knows how to have fun!

After most weekly meetings, we’ll head to the pub for a couple of (usually non-alcoholic) drinks. This is a great way to meet other CUFAS members, particularly from other years and find out about their experiences. We also have separate organised evenings out, such as bowling or meals out - if you have any ideas for social activities you'd like CUFAS to try, let us know!

May Week, at the end of Easter term, is the busiest time for us in our first aid capacity, however we still find time for some fun. Just before the May Balls get going, we head off to Grantchester one evening for a BBQ. And then while the last ball is packing up, they’ll be a Champagne Breakfast for those that have helped with May Week duties.
