As well as our first aid based events, CUFAS also knows how to have fun!

Check out the [socials events page](http://www.facebook.com/cufirstaidsoc) for details of our upcoming social events.

After most weekly meetings, we’ll head to the pub for a couple of drinks. This is a great way to meet other CUFAS members, particularly from other years, find out about their experiences, and catch up on some of our folklore!

At the end of Michaelmas and Lent terms, we’ll spend the last Tuesday session going out for dinner. In Michaelmas, this is to celebrate Christmas, usually complete with crackers and party hats! In Lent, this is combined with our AGM, where the new committee is elected.

May Week, at the end of Easter term, is the busiest time for us in our first aid capacity, however we still find time for some fun. Just before the May Balls get going, we head off to Grantchester one evening for a BBQ. And then while the last ball is packing up, they’ll be a Champagne Breakfast for those that have helped with May Week duties.

We’ve got some extra ideas for this year, so watch your inbox or [our Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/cufirstaidsoc) for things like formal dinners in the grand setting of a Cambridge college, and a bowling trip!
