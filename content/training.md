## For SJA members

For members of the Cambridge Universities Unit and the wider Cambridge Network, St John runs a series of first aid courses, including Community First Aider (CFA), Emergency Responder (ER), and Emergency Ambulance Crew (EAC) courses. For more information, you can [email our training lead](mailto:firstaid-training@srcf.net).

The Community First Aider course involves 2 days of in-person training, usually on weekends, and 10 hours of self-directed e-learning. It covers topics like primary and secondary survey, CPR, and the recovery position. In return for this training, St John Ambulance requires 80 hours of Community Engagement or Event Activity per year. More details on the role are available [here](https://www.sja.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer-opportunities/volunteer-roles/Community-First-Aider/).

You may also choose to become an Emergency Responder, which involves 48 hours of face-to-face learning over 6 days and 16 hours of self-directed learning. This training allows you to administer gases like oxygen and Entonox, measure blood pressures, blood sugar, and oxygen levels, manage airways, and treat spinal injuries. You can also train as a cycle responder or a medical response team member. More details are available [here](https://www.sja.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer-opportunities/volunteer-roles/Emergency-Responder/). As an ER, you are expected to complete 100 hours of voluntary event cover per year.

For experienced ERs, the next step is the EAC course, where you qualify to crew an ambulance. This includes thorough patient surveys, additional anatomical knowledge, and training in the use of ambulance equipment like trolleys and scoop stretchers. Recruitment to this role is currently unavailable.
