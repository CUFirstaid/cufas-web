  description: St John takes on a wide range of events, including most May Balls and June Events. If you would like to request first aid cover from St John Ambulance, fill out their form on their website. To ensure that all event-related enquiries are handled smoothly and efficiently, we kindly ask that they be submitted through the designated portal below rather than contacting committee members directly.
